# Explainable AI (XAI) at Wonderlic
This repository provides example explanations of the predictions that our machine learning models make, as well as relevant packages and articles related to explainable AI (XAI). Explainability is a critical indicator of successful AI at Wonderlic, as a deep understanding of how our models make decisions allows us to ensure that our predictions are based on job-relevant information and that they avoid unwanted bias.

Our first walkthrough provides an example of AI explanation for one of our proprietary KSA (knowledge, skills, and abilities) classification models. In the walkthrough, we demonstrate how to identify which features are most important for predicting the presence of a given KSA in a job description at both a general level and at the level of a specific inference.

For more information on our KSA classification models, see our article at: https://wonderlic.ai/blogs/job-analysis/
